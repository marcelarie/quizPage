    answered with respect to the total (this bar should be displayed on all pages
    and should be updated after answering each question).
[] 4. The progress bar will be divided into sections (eg, HTML, CSS, JS ...) and
    should be updated dynamically each time a question is answered using a
    CSS3 animation.
[] 5. After answering each question the result will be stored in memory.
[] 6. The first screen that will be shown as you can see in the wireframe will ask
    the user for a nickname
[] 7. The first screen that will be shown as you can see in the wireframe will ask

[] 8. All the evolutionary will be carried out memory and without a database, using
     HTML, CSS and Javascript (NO third-party libraries can be used)
[] 9. Write clear and concise commits, should not extend more than 50 characters.
[] 10. It has to be responsive and you must get it without using third-party libraries.

     score by a button. When refresh the page all information are cleaned and
     ranking are empty. ( Show the correct message for the user )
[] 13. All code included comments need to be write in English
[] 14. Use a code style like camelCase
[] 15. In the case of using HTML never use inline styles
[] 16. In the case of using different programming language always define the
     implementation in separate terms
[] 17. It is recommended to divide the tasks into several subtasks so that you can
     associate each particular step of the construction with a specific
     commitment.
[] 18. For the project documentation a PDF version is required within the repository
[] 19. You should try as much as possible that the commits and planned tasks are
