15/10/20 - When I added the first functions to the quiz.js the function startQuiz didn't
           work properly. I searched a solution everywhere, at the end was a type-error.

16/10/20 - When I added the function nextQuestion give me the error "Cannot set property 'innerText' of null".
           I found the solution here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55492691/cannot-set-property-innertext-of-null
           At the end it was that my script wasn't defer.

16/10/20 - Another error after fixing the one before. The problem was that I used a class to refer to .questions. I changed
           to an id="" and everything works perfect now.

16/10/20 - Error quiz.js:21 Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'forEach' of undefined
                at showQuestion (quiz.js:21)
                at nextQuestion (quiz.js:17)
           At the end I just needed to type answers and now answer :(
